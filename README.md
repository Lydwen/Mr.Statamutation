# Mr.Statamutation

Thanks to Mr.Statamutation, you can make mutants in order to ~~destroy the world~~ be sure your code is the right one.

## What is mutation testing?

Mutation testing is a type of software test. We create alternatives version of a program  (a mutant) where the code is slightly modified. If after the unit test and the integration test there is no fail, it proves that there is a problem in the original code and some tests are missing. It happens that there isn't any problem in the original code, it's just the generated mutant is the same program that the original.

So, if you have just a few mutants that doesn't produce a fail, you can be more confident that your program is working.

## What is Mr.Statamutation?

It's a framework to automate the process of creating a set of mutants, run the tests for each of them and generate a HTML Report with all the results.

## Why "Mr.Statamutation"?

Mr.Statam is a famous "Rocket League" player, so amazing that some team members (Kévin and Tom) thinks he is a mutant. It was obvious for us that our projet needs to be called "Mr.Statamutation"!
